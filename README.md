This project was a class project in Deep Learning course, and the source language and target language are non-real languages but made up with Roman alphabet characters.
I used the model where four transformers are stacked to translate the source language to the target language and achieved 99% testing accuracy for this project.

I also tested RNN model with bidirectional GRU layer, but the performance of the RNN tranlator was not as good as the transformer.
