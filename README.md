This project was a class project in Deep Learning course, and the source language and target language are non-real languages but made up with Roman alphabet characters.
I used the model where four transformers are stacked to translate the source language to the target language and achieved 99% testing accuracy for this project (See transformer_tranlsator.ipynb).

I also tested RNN model with bidirectional GRU layer, but the performance of the RNN tranlator was not as good as the transformer (See RNN_translator.ipynb).

Directory model is where tranlstor models are saved and Directory data is where the datasets are saved.

For future project, I will extend machine translation to English-French dataset.
